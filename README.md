## My process

I started off with the HTML and proceeded with the CSS afterwhich i got stuck for 5days after completing every other thing, but creating my border-box became nearly impossible. I really wanted to do it all by myself but i quickly learnt asking for help wasn't a show of weakness but an opportunity to learn. I asked for help and realized i had gone through a complicated route after which i was taught, and also watched some videos on youtube and retook some courses again. After this, i started from scratch and some parts were coded along which took away the fun part of finding solutions to things by myself but i'm hopeful about my next project. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. I learnt how to better group my div classes for a cleaner code and more effective coding practice. 

2. i moved things around alot and this helped me learn alot about margins and padding, rems and px. 

3. Most importantly, i was able to properly learn css content boxing and practiced my flexbox as well. This has been by biggest problem recently. 

4. I learnt how to deploy my project using github and netlify. Github was very confusing for me ( still is ) but i was forced to learn how to work the repo and have my project hosted using netlify ( very exciting!)

This is my first project and i'm even more excited to start the next one. 


### Continued development
My Css skills, although getting better, still needs a lot of work to get to the point where i'm comfortable enough to take on challenges and able to get through up to 90% relying on my knowledge. I will be focusing alot on also developing my Flexbox and Css grid going forward.
